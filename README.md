# Portfolio Assignment

Hello! These HTML documents represent a portfolio website that that includes 3 sections: 

*  About
* Portfolio
* Contact

## About

My 'About' section includes a bio of who I am as a person and interests in life. The purpose of this page is help portray a clear picture of myself to the user viewing the page.

## Portfolio

The 'Portfolio' section provides a mock portfolio of all my past pseudo work. This page is supposed to not necessarly provide access to all of the projects I have worked on in the past, but to show what the webpage can look like for a portfolio.

## Contact

In the 'Contact Page' I have provided areas to input your name, email, and message/question to mock contact me with any questions or concerns.



# Conclusion

My main motivation for this project was not necessarly to design an actual portfolio website for myself, but to understand the concepts that go behind designing a website with HTML and CSS. All in all, I think why I was so invested in this project was to help create a mindset for a smoother workflow for myself. Throughout the process of putting all the html/css together, I needed to constantly re-evaluate the correct way of how to use certain style selectors or choosing the right elements. In the midst of all the trial and error I have had making this website, I have indeed generated a smoother workflow; whether if it's how I go about getting information I don't know via google or using chrome inspector to troubleshoot my code before I make any changes in VScode. I now feel more confident with how a website is put together compared to how I felt in the beginning, I think what makes my portfolio stand out for this assignment is how close I got for most of the small details that are in the examples that I was assigned to match.
